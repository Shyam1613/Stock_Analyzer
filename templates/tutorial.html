        <h2>Stock Market</h2>
        <br>
        <p >
            The stock market, also known as the equity market or share market, is a public marketplace where investors can buy and sell ownership in publicly traded companies. In the stock market, companies raise capital by selling shares of their ownership to investors, and investors can buy and sell those shares on an exchange.

        <h2>Price-To-Earning Ratio</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share (EPS). In other words, it represents the amount investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings generated by the company.
        A high P/E ratio may indicate that investors have high expectations for a company's future growth prospects, while a low P/E ratio may suggest that the company is undervalued or that investors have concerns about its future prospects. However, it's important to note that the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation when evaluating a company's potential, as other factors such as the company's financial health, competitive landscape, and industry trends also play a crucial role.

        <h2>Price-to-Book</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The P/B ratio is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its book value per share (BVPS). Book value represents the value of a company's assets that remain after subtracting its liabilities. BVPS is calculated by dividing the company's total book value by the number of outstanding shares.

            A high P/B ratio may indicate that investors have high expectations for a company's future growth prospects or that its assets are in high demand, while a low P/B ratio may suggest that the company is undervalued or that investors have concerns about its future prospects. However, as with the P/E ratio, it's important to consider other factors when evaluating a company's potential, as the P/B ratio does not take into account intangible assets such as brand value, intellectual property, or goodwill.</p>

        <h2>Debt to Equity ratio</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The D/E ratio is calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholders' equity. Total liabilities include both short-term and long-term debts, such as loans, bonds, and other forms of borrowings, while shareholders' equity represents the amount of capital invested in the company by its owners.

            A high D/E ratio may indicate that a company is highly leveraged and has a greater financial risk, as it may struggle to repay its debts in a challenging economic environment or if its cash flows decline. A low D/E ratio may suggest that the company has a lower debt burden and may be better positioned to weather economic challenges. However, as with other financial ratios, it's important to consider the company's industry, business model, and other financial metrics before making an investment decision.</p>
